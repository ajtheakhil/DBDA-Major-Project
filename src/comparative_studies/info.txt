Following a literature review, we have decided to examine three distinct approaches to forecasting stock values. 
1) Neural Network + Long Short-Term Memory
2) Convolutional Neural Network combined with Long Short-Term Memory
3) Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA).
After running above algorithms, ARIMA was chosen.
