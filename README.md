The forecasting of Nifty 200 stocks is automated by this end-to-end Big Data pipeline. It makes use of an automated ARIMA model for time-series regression and PySpark for ingestion into HDFS/Hive. It converts unprocessed data into insights using backtested accuracy metrics and Apache Airflow orchestration.
